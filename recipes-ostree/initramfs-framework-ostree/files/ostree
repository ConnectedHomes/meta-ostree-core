    # We need to prepare the ostree deployment root to be kosher for

    # This involves stitching it together from several pieces to fill
    # in the missing details. Currently we do this as follows:
    #
    #   - bind-mount the common /var into the deployment
    #   - bind-mount the common /boot into the deployment
    #   - bind-mount the common /home into the deployment

    # Finally shuffle /rootfs to $_root/sysroot and $_root to /rootfs.
    #
    # This code mimicks the last bits of ostree-prepare-root. It shuffles
    # /sysroot, /rootfs, and the chosen ostree deployment root ($_root) around
    # so that /rootfs becomes $_root/sysroot and $_root becomes /rootfs. Then
    # eventually after the final pivot-root we end up with
    #
    #   - current $_root (IOW the ostree deployment root) as /
    #   - current /rootfs as /sysroot
    #
    # The only tricky/difficult to follow extra bit here is that we have to
    # do these operations with an extra step to avoid trying to move the
    # eventual /sysroot (now /rootfs) under itself.
